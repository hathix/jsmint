# jsMint: Refresh your JavaScript

jsMint is a smart, friendly JavaScript checking tool. Just type in some code and see it automatically checked using three smart, super-customizable tests. It provides advanced unit testing and granular feedback. 

## Usage

After `git clone`'ing this repo and `cd`'ing into the new directory, run:

```
npm install
bower install
grunt serve
```

The last command will open up `localhost:9000` which has the app running.
